# Football-E-site


Hey everybody I am into one of the most interesting topic related to my branch "CSE" which is Web-Devlopment and here in my learning process I have attempted to create an E-commerce website using HTML, CSS, JS
and did I do this all by my self so the answer is 'Not-Really' but actually i created with the help of youtube channel "codewithsadee" and in this process i have explored many new things in the site creation of which to whom i was not exposed to and after the complete learning I have make it by my own and make the changes as per what I needed and which I was want to.

Thankfully i choosen this practice-project to build my first E-Commerce site where I lwearn A LOT more thing's.
